# Kafka At Most Once

This project contains 3 branches:</br>
- The `main` branch has the basic config to publish and consume messages through Kafka Broker. </br>
- The `branch/at-most-once-producer` has the config for message delivery guarantees at most once. </br>
- And `branch/at-most-once-consumer` follow the same idea but from consumer side.
